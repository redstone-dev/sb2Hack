# sb2Hack
A Python program for easy modification of .sb2 files.

### Getting Started

To get started, you need to download a release of sb2Hack. A version of Python 3 is required as well.
- [Python 3.9.1 for Windows (64-bit)](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.1/python-3.9.1-amd64.exe)
- [Python 3.9.1 for Windows (32-bit)](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.1/python-3.9.1.exe)
- [Python 3.9.1 for Mac (Intel processors) (macOS 10.9 and later, but not on macOS 11)](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.1/python-3.9.1-macosx10.9.pkg)
- [Python 3.9.1 for Mac (Intel AND M1, experimental) (macOS 10.9 and later)](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.1/python-3.9.1-macos11.0.pkg)

sb2Hack handles all the decompression and project.json editing for you, so no need to do anything there.
After that, you go to a terminal window and type this:
```bash
cd /DownloadDirectoryName/sb2Hack
python3 sb2hack.py
```
This will run sb2Hack. It will handle the rest for you.
